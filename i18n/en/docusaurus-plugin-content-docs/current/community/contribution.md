The kratos community wants to be helped by a wide range of developers, so you'd like to take a few minutes to read this guide before you mention the problem or pull request.

## Reportings Bug or Fixing Bugs
We use github issues to manage issues. If you want to submit , first make sure you've searched for existing issues, pull requests and read our [FAQ](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/intro/faq).

When submitting a bug report, use the issue template we provide to clearly describe the problems encountered and how to reproduce, and if convenient it is best to provide a minimal reproduce repository.

## Adding new features
If you want to improve or add new features, it is recommended that you also use the issue template to create a new feature of the issue and clearly describe the requirements of the feature in the issue.

## How to submit code
If you've never submitted code on github, follow these steps:

- First, please fork items to your github account
- Then create a new feature branch based on the main branch and name it features such as feature-log 
- Write code
- Submit code to the far end branch
- Submit a PR request in github
- Wait for review and merge to the main branch

**Note That when you submit a PR request, you first ensure that the code uses the correct coding specifications and that there are complete test cases, and that the information in the submission of the PR is best associated with the relevant issue to ease the workload of the auditor.**
