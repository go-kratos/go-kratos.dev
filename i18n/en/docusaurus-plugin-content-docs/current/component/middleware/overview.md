Kratos has a series of built-in middleware to deal with common purpose such as logging or metrics. You could also implement Middleware interface to develop your custom middleware to process common business such as the user authentication etc.

## Built-in Middleware

Their codes are located in `middleware` directory.

### logging

In `middleware/logging`, this middleware is for logging the request.

### metrics

In `middleware/metrics`, this middleware is for enabling metric.

### recovery

In `middleware/recovery`ï¼Œ, this middleware is for panic recovery.

### status

In `middleware/status`, this middleware is for transformation of gRPC error.

### tracing

In `middleware/tracing`, this middleware is for enabling trace.

### validate

In `middleware/validate`, this middleware is for parameter validation.

### auth

In `middleware/auth`, this middleware is for authority check using JWT.

### ratelimit

In `middleware/ratelimit`, this middleware is for traffic control in server side.

### circuitbreaker

In `middleware/circuitbreaker`, this middleware is for breaker control in client side.

## Usage

Register it with `ServerOption` in `NewGRPCServer` or `NewHTTPServer`.

For example:
```go
// http
// define opts
var opts = []http.ServerOption{
	http.Middleware(
		recovery.Recovery(),
		tracing.Server(),
		logging.Server(),
	),
}
// create server
http.NewServer(opts...)



//grpc
var opts = []grpc.ServerOption{
		grpc.Middleware(
			recovery.Recovery(),
			status.Server(),
			tracing.Server(),
			logging.Server(),
		),
	}
// create server
grpc.NewServer(opts...)

```


## Custom Middleware
Implement `Middleware` interface.
